# Overview
Welcome to our project submission for the Agentic AI incubation! This repository contains the code and documentation for our innovative solution. Our project aims to revolutionize drug discovery and nanobody analysis by leveraging AI-driven insights and interactive visualizations.

# Explanation
Our project leverages cutting-edge technologies such as Azure OpenAI GPT, Streamlit, Py3Dmol, and RDKit to create an interactive web application. The core functionality includes:

**Feature 1**: Virtual Research Assistant for answering complex drug discovery queries.

**Feature 2**: Nanobody Design Lab for simulating team discussions and generating detailed reports.

**Feature 3**: Result Analysis and Metrics for visualizing nanobody design metrics across multiple rounds.

**Feature 4**: Experimental Data Correlation for analyzing computational predictions against experimental results.

**Feature 5**: Molecule Structure Prediction for generating and analyzing 3D structures of proteins and nanobody molecules.

# Intent
The primary intent of our project is to accelerate drug discovery and nanobody design by integrating AI-driven insights with experimental data. We aim to provide researchers with a comprehensive platform for analyzing, visualizing, and improving nanobody designs.

## üåü Why Choose Virtual Lab?
**Accelerated Drug Discovery**: By integrating AI-driven insights with experimental data, this platform can significantly reduce the time required for drug discovery without human intervention.

**Interactive Visualizations**: Provides intuitive and interactive dashboards for analyzing nanobody designs and experimental results, enabling researchers to make data-driven decisions effortlessly.

**Collaborative Research**: Simulates team discussions and decision-making processes autonomously, ensuring better collaboration and alignment among virtual agents.

**Comprehensive Analysis**: Combines computational predictions with experimental data for a holistic approach to nanobody design, eliminating the need for manual analysis.

**Scalability**: Designed to handle large datasets and complex workflows, making it suitable for academic, industrial, and pharmaceutical research environments.

# Use Case

**Life Sciences: Virtual Lab**

Virtual research assistant that demonstrate how a multi-agent system can replicate the capabilities of an interdisciplinary research team. The virtual research assistant could answer complex research questions by designing workflows and reason across multiple fields of science to make a series of interrelated decisions. The multi-agent system should demonstrate the ability to interface with lab equipment and/or simulate experiments without lab equipment requirement but should show the ability to agree on an experimental design, interrogate results and come to a scientific conclusion that is related to the hypothesis. 

# Challenges/Objective

Scientists often spend 20%+ of their time in designing experiments and exploring vast amounts of workflows and data. This involves accessing multiple systems, models, and documents.‚Äã

To solve this problem, technology providers attempted to deploy GenAI solutions but faced many issues such as: model hallucination and inability to understand context. On the other hand, a multi-agentic system can cope with varying degrees of complexity in research and augment scientists' day to day work.‚Äã

The objective of the virtual research assistant is to revolutionize the current ways of working and automate parts for the scientific research process.

# Solution

A multi-agentic system with a user-friendly interface. The virtual research scientist uses the power of a multi-task LLM agent to augment scientists work and build accurate research workflows. The multi-agent system needs to demonstrate the following:‚Äã

Ability to build out scientific reasoning capability (through different agents working together and/or utilization of scientific models)‚Äã

Call-outs to at least one specialized scientific tool (e.g. small or large molecule modelling tools)‚Äã

Accessing key scientific data bases (e.g. biobanks, pdb, pubmed)‚Äã

A feedback loop that demonstrates how the system may learn

# Our solution is designed to be used by:
**Researchers**: For analyzing nanobody designs and improving therapeutic efficacy.

**Pharmaceutical Companies**: For accelerating drug discovery workflows.

**Academics**: For studying protein-nanobody interactions and designing experiments.

## It can be applied in scenarios such as:

**Scenario 1**: Designing nanobodies for targeting disease-related proteins.

**Scenario 2**: Visualizing and analyzing experimental data for nanobody efficacy.

**Scenario 3**: Generating 3D molecular structures for drug discovery.
